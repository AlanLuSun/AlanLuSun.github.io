excerpt: '> *>IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2022)*<br>*>**Changsheng Lu**, Piotr Koniusz*<br>>Current non-rigid object keypoint detectors perform well on a chosen kind of species and body parts, and require a large amount of labelled keypoints for training. Moreover, their heatmaps, tailored to specific body parts, cannot recognize novel keypoints (keypoints not labelled for training) on unseen species. In this paper, we propose a versatile Few-shot Keypoint Detection (FSKD) pipeline which could not only detect base keypoints but also novel keypoints for unseen species.'
