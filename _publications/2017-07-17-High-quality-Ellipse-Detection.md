We propose a novel ellipse detection method based on arc-support line segments. Different from the traditional ellipse detector extracting line segments from the binary edge map, the proposed arc-support line segment derives from grey-level image, and integrates abundant gradient and geometry information which is critical in ellipse detection. In consideration of the continuity and convexity, we link arc-support line segments at point statistics level to form groups in a robust manner. Afterwards, two different methods are proposed to generate the initial ellipse set locally and globally, respectively. The first one selects the group with higher saliency to fit the ellipse directly, while the second one seeks all the valid pairwise groups via corresponding polarity analysis, region restriction and adaptive inliers criterion. In the ellipse fitting step, we develop a superposition principle of direct least-squares ellipse fitting to speed up fitting process. Then, we simplify the 5D initial ellipse set through the hierarchical clustering and formulate the ellipse candidate set. Finally, salient elliptic hypotheses are selected under the fair evaluation and effective verification. Experimental results on several public and self-collected datasets highlight the performance of proposed method compared to state-of-the-art detectors.
