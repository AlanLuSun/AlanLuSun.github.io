The Advanced Academic Writing course is opened by Mr. Bruce Rogers who has abundant teaching experience, and I serve as a TA in this course. Here, we could not only gain lots of academic writing knowledge but also join some interesting activities such as "international conversation lunch", "bicycling trip" and so on.
