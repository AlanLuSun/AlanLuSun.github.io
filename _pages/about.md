>I received the B.S. degree in Automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2017. Currently, I am a M.S. student with the Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. <!--My current research interests include artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, image processing and robotics.--> 
I have wide research interests mainly including artificial initelligence, image processing, machine learning, patern recognition and robotics. Particularly, I am interested in the theories and algorithms that empower robot to see, think and conduct more like a human by incorporating the techneques of some successful stories of deep learning.  

>Previously, I was listed in the first term of Huawei F(X) future scientist program member and enjoyed one-month summer internship in Huawei Nanjing Rearch Institute in 2016. From Oct. 20, 2016 to May 1, 2017, I served as a part-time duty personnel in Joint Stars Technology CO., LTD, Nanjing, where I gained lots of knowledge about industrial standards and engineeing implementation.  

>I look forward to starting a meaningful and wonderful Ph.D. period and proceeding the corresponding excercise after my M.S. graduation in 2019. It would be very grateful for your passionate advice~~
