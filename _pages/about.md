<!-- >**Looking for Job Opportunity:** I am looking for PostDoc/Assi. Prof./Assi. Researcher opportunities. Kindly let me know if I am suited to the job and you are interested in working with me. Many thanks :) -->

>**Mentorship & Collaboration:** From times to times, I mentor students and am passionate to collaborate with people on amazing research projects/ideas. *If you would like to collaborate with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email*. 

>**Changsheng Lu** [[CV-English](https://alanlusun.github.io/files/CV_LuChangsheng_EN.pdf), [CV-中文](https://alanlusun.github.io/files/CV_LuChangsheng_CN.pdf)] obtained his PhD degree from the [School of Computing](https://comp.anu.edu.au/) at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in Jan 2025. His PhD supervisors are [Dr. Piotr Koniusz](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~koniusz/), [Dr. Liang Zheng](https://zheng-lab-anu.github.io/), and [Prof. Stephen Gould](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/). Previously, he received the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, in 2020, and received the B.S. degree in Automation from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, in 2017. He has wide research interests across computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Particularly, he is interested in the theories and algorithms that may improve a robot or an intelligent device's peception, cognition and reasoning ability, which could empower the machine to see, think and conduct more like a human.  

>Currently, he is focusing on the research topics in **multimodal generic vision**, **keypoint detection**, **zero- and few-shot learning**, **foundation model**, and **transfer learning**.

<!-- >Previously, he was awarded the national scholarship for graduate student, and listed in the first term of Huawei F(X) future scientist program member and the outstanding undergraduate of Southeast University. He had a summer internship in Huawei Nanjing Research Institute in 2016. From Oct. 20, 2016, to May 1, 2017, he served as a part-time duty personnel in Joint Stars Technology CO., LTD, Nanjing, where he gained lots of knowledge about industrial standards and engineering implementation. -->  

<!-- >I look forward to starting a meaningful and wonderful Ph.D. period and proceeding with the corresponding exercise after my M.S. graduation in 2020. It would be very grateful for your passionate advice~~ -->
