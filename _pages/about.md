Currently, he is a PhD student with the [College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/) at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), and works with his supervisor [Dr. Piotr Koniusz](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~koniusz/). He has wide research interests mainly including computer vision, image processing, transfer learning, pattern recognition, and robotics. Particularly, he is interested in the theories and algorithms that may improve a robot or an intelligent device's peception, cognition and reasoning ability, which could empower machine to see, think and conduct more like a human.  

>Previously, he was awarded the national scholarship for graduate student, and listed in the first term of Huawei F(X) future scientist program member and the outstanding undergraduate of Southeast University. He had a summer internship in Huawei Nanjing Research Institute in 2016. From Oct. 20, 2016, to May 1, 2017, he served as a part-time duty personnel in Joint Stars Technology CO., LTD, Nanjing, where he gained lots of knowledge about industrial standards and engineering implementation.  

<!-- >I look forward to starting a meaningful and wonderful Ph.D. period and proceeding with the corresponding exercise after my M.S. graduation in 2020. It would be very grateful for your passionate advice~~ -->
