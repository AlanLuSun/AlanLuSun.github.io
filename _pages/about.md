>**Changsheng Lu (卢长胜)** [[CV-English](https://alanlusun.github.io/files/myCV-EN.pdf), [CV-中文](https://alanlusun.github.io/files/myCV-CN.pdf)] received the B.S. degree in Automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2017. Currently, I am an academic M.S. student with the Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. <!--My current research interests include artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, image processing and robotics.--> 
I have wide research interests mainly including artificial intelligence, image processing, machine learning, pattern recognition, and robotics. Particularly, I am interested in the theories and algorithms that empower robot to see, think and conduct more like a human by incorporating the techniques of some success stories of deep learning.  

>Previously, I was listed in the first term of Huawei F(X) future scientist program member and enjoyed one-month summer internship in Huawei Nanjing Research Institute in 2016. From Oct. 20, 2016, to May 1, 2017, I served as a part-time duty personnel in Joint Stars Technology CO., LTD, Nanjing, where I gained lots of knowledge about industrial standards and engineering implementation.  

<!-- >I look forward to starting a meaningful and wonderful Ph.D. period and proceeding with the corresponding exercise after my M.S. graduation in 2020. It would be very grateful for your passionate advice~~ -->
